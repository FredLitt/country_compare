This app compares stats between two user entered countries or two randomized countries. I created it to gain familiarity with TypeScript and using third-party APIs. It uses RESTCountries to get country data and Leaflet to create the map.

The app is hosted on Heroku: http://country-compare.herokuapp.com/
